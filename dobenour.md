My name is Demi Marie Obenour and I am a computer science major.
I have worked on several open-source projects, including the
Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), my own open-source projects
[Sliprock](https://github.com/DemiMarie/SlipRock) and
[RustyScheme](https://github.com/DemiMarie/RustyScheme), OCaml, Rust, and others.  I currently work part-time for [ReviewBox](https://getreviewbox.com).
